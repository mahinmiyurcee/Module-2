## Module-2

#Salary Data Processing Project#

#Overview#
This project involves processing and analyzing salary data for employees. The provided Jupyter Notebook demonstrates how to import data, process it, and handle errors. It also includes functionality to export employee details and instructions for using R to display the data.

#Project Structure#
SalaryDataProcessing.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook with Python code to process the salary data.
employee_data.csv: The CSV file containing the salary data.
README.md: This README file with project details and instructions.
Requirements
Python 3.x
pandas
numpy
Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
R (for unzipping and displaying the data)
Installation
Clone the Repository

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
Navigate to the Project Directory

bash
Copy code
cd your-repo
Install Required Python Packages

You can use pip to install the required Python packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy
Install R (if not already installed)

Follow the installation instructions for R from CRAN.

Usage
Python Code in Jupyter Notebook
Open Jupyter Notebook

Navigate to the project directory and start Jupyter Notebook:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Run the Notebook

Open SalaryDataProcessing.ipynb and run the cells to:

Import the salary data.
Process the data to calculate average salary details.
Handle errors and export data to a CSV file.
Export and Unzip Data with R
Export Employee Details

The Python notebook will generate a CSV file containing employee details.

Unzip and Display Data

Use the following R script to unzip and display the data:

r
Copy code
# R script to unzip and display data
library(readr)

# Unzip the folder
unzip("Employee Profile.zip", exdir = "Employee Profile")

# Read and display the CSV file
employee_data <- read_csv("Employee Profile/employee_details.csv")
print(employee_data)
Save this script as unzip_and_display.R and run it using R.

Error Handling
The Python code includes error handling to manage issues such as non-numeric values in numeric columns. Ensure that the data file is correctly formatted to avoid errors during processing.
